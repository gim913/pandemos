asap issues:
 - there should be no need to add item to elements when throwing and animation mode disabled
 - limit mouse movement when in 'throw' action

tech issues:
 - drop dumb args from astar handlers

random list of *things*
 - (remotely activated) traps, mines
 - granades

 - swim ability - different speed in water and on ground
 - wild idea action queue items replacement - i.e. in the middle of move, but if hit by player, could replace action with strike-back (and proper action points progress) - not sure if good idea

 - minimap - somewhat done
