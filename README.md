## *dev does the complete roguelike toutorial

### Week 1

I'll be using [love2d](https://love2d.org).
I'm using vscode with [love2d support extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=pixelbyte-studios.pixelbyte-love2d)

Nice part is love2d already does basic game loop.

More problematic part is that to keep UI nice and responsive when doing some longer operations
(i.e. level generation) some nice tricks will be needed.
